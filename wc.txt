"wc" is the word count command

It can return the word, line, character and byte count. If just $ wc typed you get the default output of 
word / line / byte counts.. (w / l / c )

e.g. wc grep.txt 
=>  12      75     408 grep.txt

Use the following switches to get specific counts.
-w word count
-l line count
-c bytes
-m character count (nb includes spaces)

You can combine counts for files and wc can give you a total for each switch specified...
E.g $ wc -mlc grep.txt cp.txt
=>  12      75     408 grep.txt
    5      32     184 cp.txt
    17     107     592 total

Can obviously be used to count output from pipes.
