"grep" command allows you to search for specific words in files. 

It takes two parameters - first the word you're searching for and secondly the type of file you're searching for.

E.g. $ grep README .txt

Often used alongside a pipe e.g.
$ find ~ -name "*.txt" -print | grep README
Finding any .txt files from the home directory with README in.

Or,
$ find ~ -name "*.txt" -print | grep LongText | wc â€“l
