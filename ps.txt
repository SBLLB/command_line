"ps" is the process command. It lists the processes running.

To list all processes running on your computer use the -x flag.
$ ps -x 

To sort through the vast number of processes running on your computer and look for specific processes
use a pipe. 

E.g. $ ps -x | grep bash
=>  40224 ttys000    0:00.28 -bash
    40539 ttys000    0:00.00 grep bash
