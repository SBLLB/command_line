"mv" is the move command. It can be used to move a file's location, or to rename a file. 
You only end up with one file rather than the copy ("cp") command where you end up with two. 

It takes 2 parameters. First is the orginal file name and location. Second the new file name and location.

$ mv <file1> <file2>

If you're in the folder you don't need to specify location. 
e.g. $ mv oldName newName  will simply rename the file to 'newName' but keep it in the same directory path.

Moving a file examples:

$ mv movingFile ../movingFile  moves 'movingFile' from the current directory to the parent directory. 

$ mv ../parentFile ./currentFile  moves 'parentFile' from the parent directory into the current directory.
It also renames the file to 'currentFile' in the process. 

$ mv ~/documents/coding/makers/git_revision.docx ~documents/coding/makers/revision/git_revision.docx

If were in the makers dir I could execute this more simply...
$ mv git_revision.docx ./revision/git_revision.docx

If I am in the makers dir and want to create a sub dir to hold the moving file, simply reference the desired dir's path 
in the second parameter, the command will actual create that sub dir!
